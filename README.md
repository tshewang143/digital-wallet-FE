## Running the app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Building the app

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Using the app

This is a basic todo list app that allows you to register a user (or multiple users) and manage multiple todo lists per user.

Features:

* Create user accounts and save your todo data.
* Create and manage multiple todo lists and track completed tasks.
* Full session and state mangement.
* Serialization and deserialization of user and session data (via your own browser's local storage).
* Responsive UI design using [```Angular Material```](https://material.angular.io/).

To use the app, you must first register a user. Once you have created a user, you will be redirected to the homepage, where you can start creating and managing todo lists.
